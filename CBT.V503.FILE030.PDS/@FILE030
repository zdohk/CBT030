//*               I'VE CODED 2 SIMPLE USERMODS TO THE SYSGEN MACRO  *   FILE 030
//*           SGIEA2D2 ON AGENLIB.  VERY SIMILAR CODING CAN BE      *   FILE 030
//*           USED EITHER ON SP1.3 OR ON XA.  ONLY THE SEQUENCE     *   FILE 030
//*           NUMBERS ARE DIFFERENT.  THIS IS GOOD AT LEAST UNTIL   *   FILE 030

//*           NOT NECESSARY, BECAUSE PFKEYS ARE SET IN A PARMLIB    *   FILE 030

//*           PROCESS SETS ALL CONSOLES WITH THE SAME PFKEYS.       *   FILE 030
//*           AT LEAST YOU CAN GET THE DEFAULTS CLOSER TO WHAT      *   FILE 030

//*           BE EDITED AND CUSTOMIZED TO YOUR SHOP.  THEY MUST     *   FILE 030

//*               JUST USE MY SYSMODS AS MODELS.  COMPARE THEM TO   *   FILE 030
//*           THE VERSION OF MACRO SGIEA2D2 THAT YOU HAVE ON YOUR   *   FILE 030
//*           AGENLIB LIBRARY.  BE VERY CAREFUL WITH THE SEQUENCE   *   FILE 030
//*           NUMBERS, AND IT'D PROBABLY BE BEST TO FOLLOW MY       *   FILE 030

//*           MY MVS/370 SYSTEM, BUT I AM UNABLE TO TEST THE XA     *   FILE 030
//*           VERSION HERE.  A FRIEND ASSEMBLED AN XA SYSGEN WITH   *   FILE 030
//*           THE "IEBUPDTE"ED MACRO, AND THIS WAS SUCCESSFUL.  I   *   FILE 030
//*           COULDN'T PERSONALLY TEST THE RECEIVE, APPLY, AND      *   FILE 030
//*           ACCEPT OF THE XA USERMOD.  IT'S OK, HOWEVER.          *   FILE 030
